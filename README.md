# TierList-Generator
Just a random idea I had. You can generate random tier lists using the images in the "images" folder.

Use the "top_tier" folder for a different set of characters.

# Installation
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements, then run `python3 main.py` to run the main program.

# Contribution
You can make any changes and I'll review them if I get the time to (or you could donate to my PayPal misuteriasuke@gmail.com)
